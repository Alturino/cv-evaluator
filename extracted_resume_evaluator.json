  "cv_feedback": "Ricky presents a strong profile for a general backend developer with excellent skills in modern technologies like Go, Java, Node.js, various databases, Docker, and Kubernetes. His projects demonstrate a proactive learning attitude and ability to build scalable systems. However, a significant gap exists in the crucial AI/LLM development and integration experience, which is a core component of this Product Engineer role. His professional experience is also quite junior and lacks specific backend focus or measurable achievements.",
  "project_score": 3,
  "project_feedback": "Ricky's projects, 'Hedonify' and 'Open Music API', demonstrate strong capabilities in building scalable backend systems, microservices, and utilizing various languages (Go, JavaScript, Java) and databases (PostgreSQL, Redis). The 'Learn Kubernetes' project highlights practical DevOps and cloud-native infrastructure skills. These projects align well with the classic backend requirements. However, none of the projects showcase exposure to or experience with AI/LLM development, vector databases, or prompt design, which are explicitly called out as key aspects of the Product Engineer role.",
  "overall_summary": "Ricky Alturino is a promising junior backend engineer with a robust set of technical skills and a clear passion for building demonstrated through his comprehensive projects. He excels in core backend development, database management, and cloud-native operations (Docker, Kubernetes). The primary challenge for this specific Product Engineer role is the complete absence of experience or stated interest in AI/LLM development and integration, which is a significant part of the job description. His professional experience is also relatively limited in terms of direct backend roles and measurable impact. While his cultural fit is strong due to his proactive learning and practical skill demonstration, the technical gap in AI/LLM makes him a less direct fit for the full scope of this position at present.",
  "technical_skills_match": {
    "score": 3,
    "feedback": "Ricky demonstrates a strong match for general backend technologies, including multiple server-side languages (Go, Java, Python, JavaScript), frameworks (Gin, Spring Boot, Express, NestJS), diverse databases (PostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDB, Redis), cloud platforms (AWS, GCP), and DevOps tools (Docker, Kubernetes). He also lists TDD, indicating experience with automated testing. The primary and significant gap is the complete lack of AI/LLM-specific skills, tools (like vector databases), or experience with prompt design, which are explicitly mentioned as critical qualifications and responsibilities for this Product Engineer role."

  "experience_level": {
    "score": 2,
    "feedback": "Ricky's professional experience is quite junior, totaling approximately 1.83 years across an L1 Engineer role and two Android Developer Internships. While the L1 Engineer role mentions 'developed, maintained applications/services,' it lacks specific backend focus or complexity. His projects are technically robust and show initiative for a junior candidate, but they are personal/course projects rather than full-time professional experience. The role description for a 'Product Engineer' implies a level of experience beyond what is presented, particularly for designing and orchestrating LLM integration and building new product features."

  "project_match": {
    "score": 3,
    "feedback": "The candidate's projects ('Hedonify', 'Open Music API', 'Learn Kubernetes') align very well with core backend development, microservices architecture, scalability, database management, and container orchestration (Docker, Kubernetes). They effectively demonstrate practical skills in building robust backend solutions. However, the projects do not feature any AI-powered systems, LLM integration, vector databases, or prompt design, which are crucial components of the Product Engineer role as described."

  "relevant_achievements": {
    "score": 2,
    "feedback": "The 'Hedonify' project demonstrates a notable achievement in building a 'scalable ecommerce microservices-based backend system' with 'queue and batch processing to handle competing orders efficiently,' which implies a focus on performance and robustness. However, specific, measurable outcomes (e.g., 'handled X transactions per second,' 'improved processing time by Y%') are absent. Professional experience responsibilities are generic and lack quantifiable impact or scale, making it difficult to assess major achievements."
  },
  "cultural_fit": {
    "score": 4,
    "feedback": "Ricky's CV strongly indicates a proactive, self-motivated learner with a clear passion for practical application. His multiple detailed projects, especially 'Learn Kubernetes', showcase a strong desire to acquire and apply new technical skills. This aligns exceptionally well with the job description's emphasis on demonstrating practical skills over academic credentials and a growth mindset. The CV is well-structured and clear, reflecting good communication of technical abilities."
